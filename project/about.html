				My name is Chuck Pierce. I've had experience both in radio and in T.V. Previously, I worked for Juma Entertainment in research/clearance where 
				I acquired new video content through licensing. Also, I worked for Meetinghouse Productions as a 
				researcher and a clip coordinator. I also worked at the Financial News Network, 
				an online-based financial news source that published unique news content throughout the trading day. 
				I was an Anchor as well as Editor/Producer. I also freelanced for Fox News Radio where I edited sound, 
				edited stories for Fox affiliates and edited the hourly business reports.  Back in 2009, 
				I graduated from the Pennsylvania State University with bachelor's degrees in both English and Journalism.  
				During my education, I was a producer/reporter for the Centre County Report, a T.V. newscast that covered news 
				around Centre County.  I also produced and reported for ComRadio, a student-run radio station at Penn State.  
				In my spare time I enjoying singing karaoke, reading, writing short stories, and learning new computer 
				coding languages.
